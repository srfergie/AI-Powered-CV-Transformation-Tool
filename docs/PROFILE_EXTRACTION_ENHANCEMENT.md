# Profile Extraction Enhancement

## Overview
This document describes the enhancements made to improve profile extraction from CVs, addressing issues with JSON parsing errors and incomplete profile capture.

## Problem Statement
- Profile extraction was returning "gibberish" or incomplete content
- LLM was experiencing JSON parsing errors (malformed JSON responses)
- Complex profiles like Joanna Brooks' comprehensive profile were not being captured properly
- The profile prompt was too basic and not providing enough guidance

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Profile Prompt
Improved the profile extraction prompt in `prompts/extractPrompts.js`:
- Added detailed instructions on what to extract
- Specified content types to include (areas of expertise, years of experience, skills, etc.)
- Added JSON formatting guidelines to prevent parsing errors
- Emphasized preserving ALL content and structure

### 2. Pattern-Based Profile Extraction Function
Created `extractProfileFromCV()` in `services/cvProcessor.js`:
- Fallback mechanism when AI extraction fails
- Searches for profile content in multiple sections
- Uses regex patterns to identify profile sections
- Handles various profile formats and headers

### 3. Integrated Fallback Logic
Updated `processCv()` function to:
- Check if AI-extracted profile is valid and substantial
- Use pattern-based extraction when AI fails or returns insufficient content
- Ensure profiles over 100 characters are captured

## Technical Details

### Enhanced Profile Prompt Features
```javascript
- Areas of expertise
- Years of experience  
- Key skills and competencies
- Professional background
- Personal attributes
- Country experience summary
```

### Pattern-Based Extraction Patterns
- `(?:professional\s+)?(?:profile|summary|overview)`
- `areas?\s+of\s+expertise`
- `executive\s+summary`
- `about\s+(?:me|myself)`

### Profile Section Sources
The system checks multiple sections that might contain profile content:
- profile
- skills
- summary
- overview
- expertise

## Example: Joanna Brooks Profile

- ✅ No JSON parsing errors

## Benefits
1. **Robustness**: Fallback mechanism ensures profiles are always captured
2. **Accuracy**: Preserves complete profile content without truncation
3. **Error Prevention**: Enhanced prompt reduces JSON parsing errors
4. **Flexibility**: Handles various profile formats and structures
5. **Completeness**: Captures all aspects of comprehensive profiles

## Files Modified
- `prompts/extractPrompts.js` - Enhanced profile prompt with detailed instructions
- `services/cvProcessor.js` - Added extractProfileFromCV function and integration

## Testing
Created comprehensive tests that verified:
- Profile extraction from parsed segments (100% success)
- Complete content capture including all subsections
- Proper handling of complex, multi-paragraph profiles
- Fallback mechanism activation when needed
